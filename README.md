### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Factored. I love Dilettant'n Data Science. 

- To check out what I am currently doing, follow me on Twitter at [@DavidSalazarVir](https://twitter.com/DavidSalazarVir) or my personal [blog](https://david-salazar.github.io/). I write mostly about Extreme Value Theory, Bayesian Statistics, Data Visualization and everything that has a Data Science flavor. 

Favourite blogposts:

- Replicating Taleb & Cirillo's [Tail Risk of Diseases using Extreme Value Theory within a Bayesian framework](https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/07/05/tail-risk-of-diseases-in-r/)
- Proving the [slow convergence of fat tails and the practical failure of the Central Limit Theorem](https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/05/30/central-limit-theorem-in-action/)
- Using [Instrumental Variable Regression in a Bayesian framework](https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/06/03/bayesian-instrumental-variable-regression/)
- Proving the [conditions for identifiability of causal effects in the DAG framework proposed by Pearl](https://david-salazar.github.io/2020/07/31/causality-testing-identifiability/)

Open source software

- [ggtails](https://github.com/David-Salazar/ggtails): The goal of ggtails is to make the use of fat tails specific plots as easy as possible within the usual ggplot2 framework.
