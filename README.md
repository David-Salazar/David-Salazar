### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Factored. I love Dilettant'n Data Science. 

- To check out what I am currently doing, follow me on Twitter at [@DavidSalazarVir](https://twitter.com/DavidSalazarVir) or my personal [blog](https://david-salazar.github.io/). I write mostly about Extreme Value Theory, Bayesian Statistics, Data Visualization and everything that has a Data Science flavor.
